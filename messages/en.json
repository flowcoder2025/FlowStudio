        {
          "question": "How do I generate images?",
          "answer": "Simply describe the image you want in text, or upload a reference image. The AI will automatically generate 4 images. Choose the ones you like to save or continue editing."
        },
        {
          "question": "How are credits used?",
          "answer": "Image generation costs 20 credits, and 4K upscaling costs 10 credits. New users receive free credits upon signup, and you can purchase more on the credits page. Refer friends to earn bonus credits."

          "question": "What resolution are the generated images?",
          "answer": "Images are generated at 2K (2048px) resolution by default. For higher quality, use the 4K (4096px) upscale feature. This quality is sufficient for commercial printing."
